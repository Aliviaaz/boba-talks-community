# boba talks 🍵

a community-driven, open-source archive of advice, stories, and resources - built by and for students, creatives, and early-career folks figuring it out together.  

this is a digital space to share the things we wish we knew, the notes we scribbled down from mentors, and the little sparks of inspiration that keep us going.  

no coding required. just contribute your wisdom, your story, or your vibes.

## ᯓ★ˎˊ˗ why this exists  

bobatalks has always been about conversations - about sharing what we’ve learned, what we wish we knew, and helping each other grow. this repo is an extension of that. a place where advice doesn’t disappear after an event, and stories can be revisited whenever someone needs them.
