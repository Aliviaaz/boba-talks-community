## before applying for graduate school  
- you don't need internships that muchÂ â€” research is more important! graduate programs are based more on research than technical stuff.  

## reflection  
this matters to me cause i'm planning to apply for graduate school. i talked to a professor about this and i was really worried about internships before this!
