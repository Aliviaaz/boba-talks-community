## before college
- it's okay to not have your career (much less your life) figured out. a lot of people come into college with goals set in stone and have a very static path in mind to achieve it, but the people you meet with and the experiences you'll have will often open your mind up to different options. success is not a linear path and you'll be molded by and battle tested by the challenges you face throughout college.

- you have complete autonomy over the next 4 years of your life. don't be afraid to try new things and grow as a person. unlike high school, people are pretty receptive to you experimenting and changing because everyone is so busy trying to figure out their lives. but most importantly, who cares what people think?

- you will only have these years once in your life. college is the gray area (especially at the beginning) where there's no real stress over employment while having the freedom to make your own schedule on your time. take advantage of the time you have; you'll probably be working for the next couple decades(?) of your life, don't rush your college experience and live in the present, while keeping an eye on the future!

## before your first internship
- you're probably gonna have no idea what you're doing. this is surprisingly normal and in some cases expected.
-  if you want to start off on the right foot, talk to your manager/the person deciding your conversion. get some clear guidelines on what they expect out of you and write these goals down so you can track your progress on them week by week.
- shadow other people on your team to get an idea of what they do day to day. your teammates will always be an effective blueprint to an extent, you can customize their workflows to your liking and experiment to find something that works for you.
- communication is key. an excellent communicator will almost always beat a good coder that ghosts/doesn't update teams effectively, especially in an AI-assisted SWE era.


## reflection
these pieces of advice matter to me a lot because I used to (and sometimes still) think about how different my life would be if I had just planned it out to a T and knew what I was doing from the beginning. but the beauty in life is sometimes not knowing how things will turn out and enjoying the destination. the only thing you can truly control is your effort level; just how hard are you willing to work?

## final thoughts
thanks for making it to the end!

- stay curious and hungry to learn. those traits cannot be replaced by AI.
- never say no to a learning opportunity.
- let yourself enjoy life a little.
