## ✮⋆˙ thing i wish i knew  
you don’t have to know everything before starting something. literally no one does. everyone is googling. everyone is figuring it out as they go. waiting until you feel “ready” will delay everything — just start.

## ✮⋆˙ context  
i used to think everyone in tech was some genius who knew everything already. especially at hackathons, in classes, in internships — i felt like i had to master a framework *before* i was allowed to use it. nope. wrong. the way you learn is by building, breaking it, googling, asking for help, and figuring it out on the fly.

## ✮⋆˙ advice  
- say yes to things that scare you a little.  
- being confused doesn’t mean you don’t belong — it means you’re learning.  
- ask the question. send the email. submit the project.
