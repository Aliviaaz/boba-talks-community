## before college
- **studying**: no one told me studying would be so different from high school. I remember only having to review notes the night before a test and still acing it. but in college, that just doesn't cut it. the pace is
faster, the materials run deeper, and professors expect you to come to class already having done the reading, or even researched the topic. I had to learn the hard way that saying consistent--reviewing
a little each day, actually doing the readings, and starting homework early--makes all the difference. as you might hear a lot of people say: "work smarter, not harder"
- **making friends**: making friends takes effort. at least in the computer science world, if you don't talk to someone, there's only a small chance thatthey will approach you.
  you won't always "just click" with people right away like in high school. join clubs, go to events, or simply just sit down next to someone and talk to them--you have to _put yourself out there._
- **what the hell are office hours?**: news flash, I didn't go to a single office hours (OH) in my first quarter of college: and that really sucked. you might not think you have any questions,
  but just sitting there and listening to other students ask questions may help you a lot. professors _actually_ want to help, but there's just too many students for them to be reaching out to you individually.
  going to office hours early and often can make classes easier, help you build connections, and even lead to opportunities like getting into a professor's research lab.
- **career path**: it's okay to change paths. people switch majors, drop classes, or take extra time to graduate. college is a place to explore and pivot--don't feel stuck because of a plan you made at 17.
  there's a big chance that anyone you ask in your industry didn't plan on getting this job when they were in college, or even 5 years ago. it might take some time to find out what you're actually passionate about, and that's okay.
- **misc**: no one knows what they're doing all the time. imposter syndrome is real. everyone's figuring it out as they go, even if they look like they have it all together. the one kid that always answers questions during class? there's a
  high likelihood they reviewed all the lecture material beforehand. it's okay to ask what you think might be a "dumb" question, it's okay to not understand something immediately. everyone else is in the same boat.

## reflection  
all of the items that I mentioned above were things that I was slowly trying to figure out my first year. yes, everyone's college experience is different, but I feel like these questions were so frequently asked to me
that I realized many people are facing the same problems I was. 
1. I would say that I was pretty ambitious in high school, took 10+ AS/A-Level classes/examinations and 5+ AP courses, had a 4.0 GPA, and a 35 on the ACT. BUT, this did not translate at all the same way to college.
man did my first quarter suck. I started with a difficult math course and got a 3.2, and the CS class I was in I got a 3.5. it honestly hit pretty hard, and I lowkey thought that I was failing myself. an important thing to
remember is that college GPA isn't necessarily the same as high school GPA (no one really cares about it as long as you're not getting kicked out of school). I'd study by reading the textbook once and not doing practice problems because I
thought I "got the hang of it", but come the first exam, I scored a whopping 67%. this made me realize that I needed to change the way I study. I locked in. got caught up on all the material and did an ABSURD number of practice exams before finals week
and only managed to get a 3.2 in the class, but it's fine, because I learned the content. and good news is that I still remember it a year later!
2. Having 90% of my high school friends go to the same college as me was both a blessing and a curse. don't get me wrong though--I absolutely love my friends, but being so comfortable with them, I forgot to make new friends,
in my first quarter, I basically only hung out with my roommate (who was my best friend in hs) and my other high school friends. but when my mother asked me: "vicky did you make any new friends yet?", I froze.
I did lie and tell her yes, but that also made me realize that I needed to put myself out there more, to actively talk to people, add socials, and try to understand and connect with them. when winter quarter started, I had a wonderful
study group with the most genuine and sweet people I've ever met. I am still so lucky that they're still my friends.
3. Like I said, I didn't go to a single OH during my first quarter. I thought it was borderline useless, since I could just figure out everything on my own. that was a lie. I *could* have figured out everything on
   my own, but going to OH would cut that time in half. and in college, time is very important. i started going to OH in winter quarter, even if I didn't have anything to ask. sometimes the questions my peer asked
   helped me get started on a homework problem. or, I would hear insider intel about what topics matter the most on exams. I also got to talk to my TAs and learn about their college experiences, which was honestly really cool.
4. I've always wanted to do computer science since I was in middle school, but until recently, I didn't exactly know what I wanted to specialize in. Back in high school, I thought healthcare was cool, so I did some research on that.
   but now, I think that generative AI is even cooler, so I'm vibing with that. maybe a few years from now, I'd be a recruiter or a product manager, who knows? as long as I enjoy doing what I do.
