## before graduating 
- **[ You are human ]** : Be **confident** but know your **limits**, don't be afraid to ask for help when things are feeling overwhelming. Life is about teamwork and collaboration. Stop trying to carry in your head. Start **writing**, you are human and you are bound to **forget**, that idea for a start up, a solution to a problem, or simply a reminder to do something. Start utilizing your **second brain**, get into the habit to note taking, utilizing calendars, and todo planners. Even if you prefer paper, **digitalize** them, it'll save you time, help you stay organized, and give your thoughts a place to live, instead of being forgotten.
- **[ Don't wait, start now ]** : It's all about **initiative**. Realize that, you aren't going to the only person that comes up with that big idea, and you probably aren't the first, and that's OK. You **won't fail** simply because **another exists** already. We have more than **2,000 companies** making software for healthcare alone. Success doesn't come from being first, it comes from being **persistent**.
- **[ Success is inevitable ]** : Don't worry about succeeding or failing, because if you **stay focused and stay consistent**, success is inevitable. There will be setbacks, it's part of the journey. Take time to **look back**, see how much you've grown, because sometimes, we don't realize how far we have come. **Growth is quiet**, and sometimes you don't notice it unless you pause and reflect.

## reflection  
Everything Iâ€™ve written comes from experience, from failures Iâ€™ve sat in and wins Iâ€™ve chased down. I learned what it means to **want something badly** and actually go for it. Iâ€™ve learned how easy it is to get comfortable and stop trying. At one point, I forgot how to walk.

So, to whoeverâ€™s reading this:

**Get up. Start walking.**  
You donâ€™t have to sprint. You just have to keep moving.  
Be consistent. Be relentless. Improve just a little every day. Thatâ€™s all it takes.
Success is waiting for you, but you need to go meet it.
